# Electronic-Health-Records-in-India-Feasibility-Benefits-Challenges-and-Solution
## 📌 Project Overview
This project explores the feasibility of implementing Electronic Health Records (EHR) 
in the Indian healthcare system using data analysis and AI/ML techniques.  
The study focuses on how structured health data can improve clinical decision-making, 
operational efficiency, and public health outcomes, while also addressing challenges 
such as data quality, privacy, and scalability.
